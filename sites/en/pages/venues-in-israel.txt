This page was created in 2019, long before COVID. Things have changed a lot since then.
For one I don't organize events so I have not checked if anything is still relevant in this list.

If you are an event organizer with a new group it might be tricky to find a good place for your gathering,
but even if you already have a large group with a long history you might be interested
to find alternative places to hold your events.
It can broaden the membership and can make your group more accessible to pepple living and working in other areas of the country.

On this page you'll find some of the best venues where you can organize your events. The majority seem to be in the
center of the country, especially in Tel Aviv, but I included information about other cities as well.

<h2>The questions</h2>

Throught this post I am trying to answer the following questions about each place:

<ul>
    <li>Name of the place. Obviously.</li>
    <li>Location (address).</li>
    <li>The available spaces. (number of people, types of events: presentations only, hands-on events as well, or just round-table chats?)</li>
    <li>How to get a time-slot to organize an event? (The process of registration)</li>
    <li>What kind of events and content are they interested in?</li>
    <li>At what time can event be organized?</li>
</ul>
