I went to the <a href="https://github.com/topics/golang?o=desc&s=updated">golang</a> topic of GitHub sorted by "Recently updated" and looked
at repositories that do not yet have a lot of stars. Most likely they are at an early stage so it might be easier to contribute simple things,
such as tests and GitHub Action configurations.

I found <a href="https://github.com/ricardobranco777/xhash">xhash</a> package.

=abstract end

As this is the first time I am adding GitHub Actions to a project written in Go I got a bit luck as this one had a Dockerfile
and a Makefile. Thus it was quite obvious how to run the tests.

<code>
make
make test
</code>

I also looked at a more popular Golang project to see what they have and based on that I got the following config file
that I saved as <b>.github/workflows/ci.yml</b>. Besides a small typo I got it right and now the CI runs and tests the
code on 6 different platforms.
