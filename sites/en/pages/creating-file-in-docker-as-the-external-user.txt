For a long time I had this problem that I did not know how to solve:

When you run Docker on a linux host, mount an external folder, all the files created in the docker will be owned by user <b>root</b> on the host file-system.

Finally I think I understood how this works and found a solution. At least a partial solution.

<h2>The Problem</h2>

Here is the problem again:

I run docker and mount the current folder as /opt inside the container:

<code>
$ docker run -it --rm -w /opt -v$(pwd):/opt ubuntu:23.04 bash
</code>

When inside the container I create a file and then exit the container:

<code>
# touch hello
# exit
</code>

If I look at the ownership of the file on my host computer (which is also Ubuntu):

<code>
$ ls -l hello
</code>

I get:

<code>
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Apr 26 20:35 hello
</code>

The file is now owned by user <b>root</b>.

<h2>Solution</h2>

Add the <b>--user ubuntu</b> parameter to the command:

<code>
$ docker run -it --rm -w /opt -v$(pwd):/opt --user ubuntu ubuntu:23.04 bash
</code>

Inside the container create a file and exit:

<code>
$ touch world
$ exit
</code>

Outside, on the host, check the ownership:

<code>
$ ls -l world
-rw-r--r-- 1 gabor gabor 0 Apr 26 20:38 world
</code>

It is now owned by <b>gabor</b> which is my regular user.

<h2>Explanation</h2>

In Linux each user has a user id. The user <b>root</b> has the id 0 on every Linux machine and I guess also on macOS, but I have not checked it.
So both on my host computer and inside the Docker container the user <b>root</b> has the same id.

When I ran docker in the first example (without passing the <b>--user</b> parameter), inside the container I became user <b>root</b>.
Any file I created then got the userID 0 as its owner. This is also the user <b>root</b> outside, so that's why the file is owned by
root on the host system.

The first real user on Ubuntu (and I think in general on every Linux and Unix system) will get the id 1000. So the user ID of my
user "gabor" on my host computer has the ID 1000. I could verify this by running the <b>id</b> command on my computer.

The Docker image 23.04 also comes with a default real user account which is called <b>ubuntu</b> and it also has the ID 1000.
When in the 2nd example I used the <b>--user ubuntu</b> flag I entered the container as user <b>ubuntu</b>. If I ran the <b>id</b> command there
I'd see:

<code>
$ id
uid=1000(ubuntu) gid=1000(ubuntu) groups=1000(ubuntu),4(adm),20(dialout),24(cdrom),25(floppy),27(sudo),29(audio),30(dip),44(video),46(plugdev)
</code>

showing that this user in the container also has the ID 1000.

I found out about this by listing all the users using the <b>cat /etc/passwd</b> command. It is the last row.

So when I created a file on the mounted volume the file was created as user ubuntu (id 1000) inside the container.
However on my host machine that id belongs to my regular user, so my computer sees that file as own by user gabor (id 1000).

Just as if I created it as my regular user on the host computer.

This solves the problem.

<h2>Notes and warnings</h2>

If on the host system your ID is not 1000, then this will not work, but you can create a user in the container with the ID you have
and use that username.

Now that inside the container I am user <b>ubuntu</b> I don't have the privileges of user <b>root</b> so I cannot make changes
to any of the system files. In particular I cannot install any extra software using <b>apt</b>.

I have not tried any other images. I am quite sure that the default user in a CentOS-based image won't be called "ubuntu", if it has one.
