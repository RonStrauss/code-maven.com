After the heavy-lifting of the previous entry in the Daily CI series this was a very easy task. Looking at <a href="https://cpan-digger.perlmaven.com/">CPAN Digger</a> I saw <a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/MIME-Types">MIME-Types</a>. That sounded like a simple Perl module and indeed adding CI was straight forward.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

There are many projects that are low-hanging fruits where you can add GitHub Actions in a matter of minutes and get the benefits immediately.
