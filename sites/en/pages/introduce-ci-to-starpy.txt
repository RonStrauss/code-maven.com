One of the first thing I do when start working on a project (either open source or in a corporation) is to make sure the
is a Continuous Integration system set up. In this video you will see how I added GitHub Actions to the
<a href="https://github.com/Equal-Vote/starpy/">starpy</a> project.

The points I made
<ul>
    <li>Make sure you have the python requirements listed in the <hl>requirements.txt</hl> file</li>
    <li>Make sure you can run <hl>pytest</hl> and it will find your tests. (test filenames start with <hl>test_*</hl></li>
    <li>Having a README.md is also a nice thing with instruction how to set up an environment and how to run the tests.</li>
</ul>

This is the content of the <hl>.github/workflows/ci.yaml</hl> file from the project that configures GitHub Actions.
