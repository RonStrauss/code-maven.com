Probably in every project built using <a href="/materialize">Materialize</a> all the content is wrapped in a <hl>div</hl> element with a <hl>class</hl> called <hl>container</hl>.
In this example we can see it being used.
The sample content is from <a href="https://lipsum.com/">Lorem Ipsum</a>.

Removing this <hl>div</hl> element or removing the <hl>container</hl> class from it will make the site take up the full width of the browser.
Check the <a href="/materialize-skeleton">skeleton</a> to see it.

For more details see the beginning of documentation of the <a href="https://materializecss.com/grid.html">grid</a> where this is mentioned.
