=abstract start

Probably in every project built using Materialize all the content is wrapped in a <ul>div</ul> element with a <ul>class</ul> called <ul>container</ul>
The sample content is from <a href="https://lipsum.com/">Lorem Ipsum</a>.

Removing this <hl>div</hl> element or removing the <hl>container</hl> class from it will make the site take up the full width of the browser.

For more details see the beginning of documentation of the <a href="https://materializecss.com/grid.html">grid</a> where this is mentioned.
