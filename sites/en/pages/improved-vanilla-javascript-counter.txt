This code is part of the <a href="/counter">counter example</a> project. It is an impoved version of the <a href="/vanilla-javascript-counter">Vanilla JavaScript counter</a> I posted a while ago.
This version was posted by <a href="https://dev.to/jonrandy">Jon Randy</a> as a reply to my <a href="https://dev.to/szabgab/counter-example-vanilla-javascript-1n6l">post on dev.to</a>.

A few notes as I am trying to understand this example:

<ul>
    <li>The <b>value</b> attribute of an <b>input</b> element of <b>type="button"</b> is the value shown by the browser on the button.</li>
    <li>I am still not used to the fat-arrow notation of creating anonymous functions in JavaScript that are then assigned to a variable. <b>() => code</b> is a function definition.</li>
</ul>

It is indeed a very nice use of the various default capabilities of HTML and JavaScript.
