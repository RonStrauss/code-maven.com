<h2>DIV container</h2>

Probably in every project built using Materialize all the content is wrapped in a <ul>div</ul> element with a <ul>class</ul> called <ul>container</ul>
The sample content is from <a href="https://lipsum.com/">Lorem Ipsum</a>.

Removing this <hl>div</hl> element or removing the <hl>container</hl> class from it will make the site take up the full width of the browser.

<h2>Rows and columns - a grid</h2>

In order to make it easy to place various objects on the web page, people usually use a grid. Here the grid can have multiple rows and
each row can be divided into 12 columns. The name "row" is actually slightly confusing in this context. A name such as "block" might have been better
as each "row" can actually contain several 12-width physical row.
