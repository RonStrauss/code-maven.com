I like the <a href="https://dev.to/">DEV.to</a> website, I even <a href="https://dev.to/szabgab/">posted some articles there</a>, but the infinite scrolling on some of the
pages that also have a footer is driving me mad.

Go to the page of this article on  <a href="https://dev.to/szabgab/infinite-scrolling-and-footer-dont-work-well-together-not-even-on-devto-3619">DEV.to</a> and press the END button on your keyboard.
It will jump to the bottom of the page where you'll see a footer with a number of links including one to <a href="https://www.forem.com/">Forem</a> the platform DEV runs on.

However, if you open the <a href="https://dev.to/">main page of DEV</a> or the listings of one of the <a href="https://dev.to/tags">tags</a>,
you will notice that after a very short period of time more content is loaded and the links disappear.
The automatic loading of additional content at the bottom of the page is called "*infinite scrolling*".
Unfortunately this is rendering the footer unusable on these pages making the whole experience very frustrating.

So frustrating that I decided to write a whole post about it :-)

I seemed to remember that I already complained about it, but did not remember where. I was also wondering if it only frustrates me or others as well.

So I went to the GitHub repository of the project and found several related issues:

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/forem/forem/issues/11576">Infinte scrolling needs to be fix on homepage</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/forem/forem/issues/9034">Footer should be viewable</a></li>
</ul>

And a discussion <a href="https://github.com/forem/forem/discussions/15322">Footer should be viewable</a>

I have not been able to read all the comments, but I am surprised this issue still exists. I think I'd just remove the footer from all the pages that have infinite scrolling.
