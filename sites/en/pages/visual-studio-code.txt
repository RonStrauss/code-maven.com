=abstract start

<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> is one of the most popular IDEs these days. Contributing to it would probably be cool,
but also extremely difficult. Given that is a mature product with millions of users, most likely the easy issues have all been addressed.

If you visit the web site the only indication as to how to contribute to it I found was a small GitHub logo at the bottom that leads to the
<a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/">GitHub repository of VS Code</a>
