Adding CI to Perl modules is usually quite easy as the way to install dependencies and the way to test them is almost fully standardized.
True, there are 3-4 different standards, but it is quite easy to see which standard you have.

As always I started at the <a href="https://cpan-digger.perlmaven.com/">CPAN Digger</a>. This time found the <a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/Log-Any">Log-Any</a>
distribution.
