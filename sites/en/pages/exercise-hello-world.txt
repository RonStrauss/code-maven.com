Try your environment:

<ul>
  <li>Make sure you have access to the right version of your language. Pick the language you are currently learning from the below list:
     <ul>
       <li>Perl 5: As of this writing version 5.30 is already out, but most of the material will work on 5.10 and even 5.8, if you cannot upgrade. (See the <a href="https://www.cpan.org/src/README.html">most recent release of Perl 5</a>.)</li>
       <li>Raku (formerly known as Perl 6): See the <a href="https://rakudo.org/">most recent version of Raku</a> (that was 2019.03 when I updated this).</li>
       <li>Ruby: 2.5.x will be fine. Check out the <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/">most recent version of Ruby</a>.</li>
       <li>Python: In case you have Python 2 (e.g. 2.7.x) you should strongly consider switching to Python 3. Even though if you need to maintain legacy code then you might need to know Python 2 as well.</li>
       <li>In the Python 3 series any of 3.8.x is the most recent, but most of the examples will work on older versions of Python 3 as well. See the <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">most recent version of Python</a>.</li>
       <li>Go version go1.12.9 looks fine. The you could get the <a href="https://golang.org/dl/">most recent version of Go</a>.</li>
     </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Check you can read the documentation.
<!--
