While looking for another Python project to add CI to, I encountered the <a href="https://github.com/bowentan/glob-linters/">glob-linters</a> project
that and incorrect GitHub URL in its configuration files. So before I even get to check if it has tests I went
ahead and fixed the URL.


The video started at the <a href="https://pydigger.com/">PyDigger</a> project.
