I found <a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/Win32-Wlan">Win32-Wlan</a> on <a href="https://cpan-digger.perlmaven.com/">CPAN Digger</a> as a Perl
package that does not have CI configured in its <a href="https://github.com/Corion/Win32-Wlan/">GitHub repository</a>.

=abstract end

While the indicates that this is a Windows-related thing, there are a number of packages on <a href="https://metacpan.org/">CPAN</a> that are in the
<a href="https://metacpan.org/search?size=50&q=Win32"><b>Win32</b></a> namespace, but also work on Linux. This one, it seems does not.
It seems at least one of its dependencies, the <a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/Win32-API">Win32-API</a> does not work on anything else besided
Windows.

In the <b>Makefile.PL</b> of Win32-API I saw this code:

<code>
my $running_on_windows = $^O eq 'MSWin32' || $^O eq 'cygwin' || $^O eq 'msys';
die qq(OS unsupported\n)
    unless $running_on_windows
    or $ENV{WIN32_API_BUILD}     # So I can build it on Linux too
    ;
</code>

So it can also work on cygwin and msys and it can be packaged on Linux as well.

We might be able to setup a Linux machine to build the distribution of the module and then we can run the tests
on various versions of Perl on Windows. However I did not want to invest that much time before I even
see that it would be interesting to the maintainer of the package.

The setup was quite simple as you can see from the GitHub Action config file below.

I had to remove the two most recent versions of Perl as it seems they are not available in the GitHub Action I used.
That could be improved.
