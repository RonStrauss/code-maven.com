After the success yesterday <a href="https://code-maven.com/ci-for-rdf-kv-ruby">adding CI to a Ruby Gem</a> I thought I can give another
try to more Ruby Gems so I looked at the <a href="https://ruby-digger.code-maven.com/">Ruby Digger</a>. As I can see there is even less action
there than on <a href="https://cpan-digger.perlmaven.com/">CPAN Digger for Perl</a>.

<h2>Error reports</h2>

First I looked at a project called <a href="https://github.com/zarkiel/nezekan">nezekan</a>. I tried to run the tests locally, but failed.
I am not sure if I was even trying to run them as the authors intended, but <a href="https://github.com/zarkiel/nezekan/issues/1">this error</a> seem
to be genuine. It is a case-sensitivity issue. After I fixed that locally I bumped into <a href="https://github.com/zarkiel/nezekan/issues/2">and reported another issue</a>.

Only now, that I am writing this I realized that the project had a Travis-CI configuration file. Although Travis-CI does not provide the free service any more
I could have looked at the configuration file and base my commands on that. I can get back to that later.


<h2>wp2txt</h2>

After a while I found the <a href="https://github.com/yohasebe/wp2txt">wp2txt</a> project. Adding GitHub Actions to this was quite simple
though it was different from the previous one. Here is the <a href="https://github.com/yohasebe/wp2txt/pull/11">pull-request</a>
and below you'll find a copy of the configuration file as I sent it.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Slowly, but I learn how to run the tests in the various Ruby projects as well. Unfortunately there are not very many new uploads to <a href="https://rubygems.org/">RubyGems</a>
and this <a href="https://ruby-digger.code-maven.com/">Ruby Digger</a> is growing slowly.
