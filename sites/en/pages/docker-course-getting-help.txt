In order to <a href="https://code-maven.com/slides/docker/docker-help-cli">get help with Docker</a> you can use the following
commands:

<code>
docker --help
docker help run
docker help ps
docker help images
docker help rm
docker help rmi
</code>

If you type in on the command line:

<code>
docker --help
</code>

then you will see a list of the command available for Docker. You might need to scroll-up to see the beginning of the output
or on Linux and OSX you could run it through <hl>less</hl>

<code>
docker --help 2| less
</code>


You can ask for help by typing <hl>docker help</hl> and then the name of one of the commands so <hl>docker help rmi</hl> for example
and then it gives you some kind of an explanation of what does the <hl>rmi</hl> command do.

You will find a lot more detailed documentation on the web site of the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/">documentation of Docker</a>.
There you can search using the name of the command and find all kinds of documents.
For example the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/rmi/">reference page if docker rmi</a>.

That's basically how to get help, though you can just search on your <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">favorite search engine</a>
