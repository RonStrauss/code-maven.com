Finally I managed to set up CI for a Ruby Gem.
ere <a href="https://github.com/doriantaylor/p5-rdf-kv/issues/2">were some errors</a> that stopped me from doing the regular steps.

=abstract end

A few days ago I sent a pull-request with a CI configuration to the <a href="https://code-maven.com/ci-for-rdf-kv-perl">RDF::KV module in Perl</a>.
I was not very happy with the solution, but sent the <a href="https://github.com/doriantaylor/p5-rdf-kv/pull/3">pull-request</a> anyway.
The author of the module was very responsive and soon pointed me to the step I missed, but also pointed at the <a href="https://github.com/doriantaylor/rb-rdf-kv">Ruby port of rdf-kv</a>.

Today finally I had the time to update the CI I wrote for the Perl version. (See the <a href="https://github.com/doriantaylor/p5-rdf-kv/pull/3">PR</a>) and also to add
the GitHub Actions configuration to the Ruby implementation and send the <a href="https://github.com/doriantaylor/rb-rdf-kv/pull/1">pull-request</a>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Maybe the earlier failures to set up CI for Ruby Gems wasn't even my fault. Maybe they really had failing tests.
