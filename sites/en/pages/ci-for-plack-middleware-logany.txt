Today I spent about 3-4 hours on various other projects. Managed to make good progress on some really interesting ones, but could not finish the CI for either one of them. I opened GitHub Issues reporting the problems, but I still could not get either of them done.

Finally I found this Perl module called <a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/Plack-Middleware-LogAny">Plack-Middleware-LogAny</a>.

=abstract end

I copied the CI file from <a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/Plack-Middleware-Greylist">Plack-Middleware-Greylist</a> that I created on <a href="https://code-maven.com/ci-for-two-perl-projects">day 9</a>.

The only difference is that this one passes on Windows as well.

I sent the <a href="https://github.com/XSven/Plack-Middleware-LogAny/pull/1">Pull-request</a>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

It's better to start earlier working my CI.
