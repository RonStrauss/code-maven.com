=abstract start

There are many cases in which a variable can be empty, or more correctly can contain the value <hl>None</hl> in Python.

The same with the return value of a function. We might have a function that would normally return a floating point number,
but sometimes it might return None. How can you give type-checking hints so <a href="/mypy">mypy</a> will accept the situation?

In another article we already saw how to handle the case when a <a href="/different-types-of-parameters">function parameter can have more than one type.</a>
Now we'll see a special case of that, when one of the potential values is <hl>None</hl>.

In other words, when the value is <b>optional</b>.

=abstract end

<h2>Function that returns either float or None</h2>

In this example we have function (admittedly a bit contrived example, but syntactically correct).
We add type-hinting that suggests the function is expected to always return a <b>float</b>.

<include file="examples/python/mypy/return_might_be_none.py">

Obviously it does not, so when we run <b>mypy</b> it will complain:

<code>
$ mypy return_might_be_none.py

return_might_be_none.py:7: error: Incompatible return value type (got "None", expected "float")
</code>


<h2>Using Union</h2>

Using the <hl>Union</hl> keyword from the <hl>typing</hl> module allows us to declare that a variable,
or in this case the return value of the function can be either one of 2 or more values.
In our case it is either <hl>float</hl> or <hl>None</hl>

<include file="examples/python/mypy/return_might_be_none_union.py">

Running <b>mypy</b> on it will be without complaints.


<h2>Using Optional</h2>

While Union can be used, an even better option for this case is to use the <hl>Optional</hl> keyword:

<include file="examples/python/mypy/return_might_be_none_optional.py">
