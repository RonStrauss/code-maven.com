After the failure to create GitHub configuration for <a href="https://code-maven.com/ci-for-farmworld-python">farmworld</a>
I did not know if I should call it a day or try to find something else where I manage to set up GitHub Actions.
I went back to <a href="https://pydigger.com/search/has-github-no-ci">PyDigger</a> and found the
<a href="https://github.com/firlast/wsblib">wsblib</a> Python package where the name stands for <b>Web Server Base Library</b>.

=abstract end

It had some tests in the `tests/` folder.

After looking at the test files I saw that they are using <a href="https://pypi.org/project/bupytest/">BuPyTest</a>.
I have not hear about it.
I saw that both files were prepared to be executed directly using the following:

<code>
if __name__ == '__main__':
    bupytest.this()
</code>

so I went on running them as <b>python tests/test_server.py</b>.

Later, when I went and looked at the <a href="https://github.com/jaedsonpys/bupytest/blob/master/README.md">documentation of BuPyTest</a>
and saw that it can be also used as a command-line tool.


<h2>Stages</h2>

First I only configured the CI to run on Ubuntu using Python 3.11.


Then I extended it to run the tests on all 3 operating systems and 3 different versions of Python. That's when I found out that
one of the test files consistently fails on Windows and OSX. So I configured the CI that on of the tests files will always run
and the other one only when the operating system is Ubuntu Linux.

Finally I switched from running the tests with <b>python</b> to running them using <b>bupytest</b>.

<h2>GitHub Actions configuration file</h2>

This is the most recent version of the file:

<include file="examples/wsblib/ci.yml">

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Sometimes it is simple to set up GitHub Actions, even with testing frameworks that I don't know yet.
