<a href="https://github.com/tomgrek/farmworld">FarmWorld</a> is a reinforcement learning library for agriculture written in Python.

=abstract end


This package had instruction in the README file on how to install and how to release.

It came with a <b>Makefile</b> which is a bit strange as there are python-based tools that could do the same job,
but that makefile did not have a "test" target either.

I tried to follow the instruction in the README file.

On Python 3.11 the installation failed with

<code>
Unable to find installation candidates for ale-py (0.7.4)
</code>

I reported it: <a href="https://github.com/tomgrek/farmworld/issues/1">Dependencies are missing on python 3.11</a>

On Python 3.10 the installation worked, but the tests failed with

<code>
pytest: command not found
</code>

Fair enough. There is no pytest installed.

At this point however I got a bit fed up and thought I should try it locally in a Docker container:


<h2>Trying to run in Docker container</h2>

After cloning the repository:

Start the container:

<code>
docker run -it -v$(pwd):/opt --workdir /opt --name farm ubuntu:22.04 bash
</code>


Install make, python and virtualenv:

<code>
apt-get update
apt-get install -y make
apt-get install -y python3
apt-get install -y python3.10-venv
</code>

Just to make sure we have a good version of Python I also ran <b>python3 --version</b> and the response was <b>Python 3.10.6</b>.
So it is fine.

I tried to run <b>make venv</b> but that relies on the command <b>python</b> being available. However in Linux the package is called
<b>python3</b>. So instead I executed the command manually:

<code>
python3 -m venv .venv
</code>

I also reported it: <a href="https://github.com/tomgrek/farmworld/issues/2">python is called python3 on Linux - Makefile assumes python</a>

Then I continued:

<code>
make install
</code>

Everything installed fine.

Apparently at first looking at the README file I missed the instructions on how to run the tests, but I saw two test scripts in the `test/` folder
so I installed <b>pytest</b> and then tried to run the tests:

<code>
.venv/bin/pip install pytest
PYTHONPATH=. .venv/bin/pytest test/
</code>

This gave me an error:

<code>
pygame.error: No available video device
</code>

At this point I feel I am stuck. I found some instruction on how to add video device to Docker,
but I somehow doubt I'd be able to do this on GitHub Actions.

<h2>Including test-running in the Makefile</h2>

Although I don't particularly like the use of Makefile here, but if that's what the author prefers then let's go
all the way and add the test running to it as well.

I sent a <a href="https://github.com/tomgrek/farmworld/pull/3">Pull-request</a> adding <b>tests</b> target to the Makefile


<h2>No available video device</h2>

Finally I opened and issue with the <a href="https://github.com/tomgrek/farmworld/issues/4">pygame.error: No available video device</a>
asking if there could be tests that don't require a video device.

<h2>GitHub Actions configuration file</h2>

It does not work yet (?), but let me share the configuration file I created so far. It might be useful later on.

<include file="examples/farmworld/ci.yml">

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

This time my attempt to add GitHub Actions failed, but I hope I managed to contribute a bit to this project.
