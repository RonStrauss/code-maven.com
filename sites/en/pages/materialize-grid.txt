In order to make it easy to place various objects on the web page, people usually use a grid.  In <a href="/materialize">Materialize</a>
the grid can have multiple rows and each row can be divided into 12 columns. The name "row" is actually slightly confusing in this context.
A name such as "block" might have been better as each "row" can actually contain several 12-width physical row.

For more details see the documentation of the <a href="https://materializecss.com/grid.html">grid</a>

At the bottom of the file I've added some manual CSS in order to change the background-color of the boxes.
Hopefully this will make it easier to see the individual cells in the grid.
