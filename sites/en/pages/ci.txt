=abstract start

Continuous Integration (commonly known as CI and usually talked about as part of a CI/CD pipeline) is one of the
most valuable features you can add to your software development process. The major git-hosting platforms
provide free, cloud-based CI running service, but there also various tools to set up in-house CI systems.

I provide help to individuals and teams with training, techniques, and tools for test automation, CI, and CD.

I try to help Open Source projects with the same services. This is helped by my <a href="https://szabgab.com/support.html">supporters</a>.
Both individuals and corporations.

In a separates series you can read and watch small <a href="/os">contributions to Open Source projects</a>.
Mostly configuring CI systems and adding automated tests.
